Note:  
When you just start watching a video, it will automatically enter fullscreen because I think that UI looks much better.  
But there's an issue: When you switch this app to background, the playback will pause a bit for unknown reason. :(  
If it's not in fullscreen, the playback won't be interrupted. But when you switch it back to foreground, it will also pause a bit.
