Note:
When you just start watching a video, it will automatically enter fullscreen because I think that UI looks much better.
But there's an issue: When you switch this app to background, the playback will pause a bit.
If it's not in fullscreen, the playback won't be interrupted at all and it will keep playing but the UI will looks very small.
